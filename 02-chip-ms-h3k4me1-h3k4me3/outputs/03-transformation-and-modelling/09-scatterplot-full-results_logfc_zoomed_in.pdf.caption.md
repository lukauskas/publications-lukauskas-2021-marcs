A scatterplot diagram of model estimates.
Log2 fold changes me3 vs controls (H3 and H4) of all proteins are plotted on the x axis, and the log2FC(me1/controls) on the y.

The first plot simply plots the whole data, the second plot highlights proteins used to normalise the data, while the remaining three plots highlight proteins for which
the corresponding estimates are statistically non zero. (limma, at FDR 0.05, BH correction).
Labels are displayed for a handful of outlier proteins.

Note that this plot zooms in to the area defined by the following limits: [-3, 5].
8 proteins outside of axis limits: ['CCT8 (x=-2.54, y=-3.38)', 'HSPA5 (x=-6.62, y=-7.84)', 'HSPG2 (x=-4.36, y=-5.03)', 'IGHG1 (x=7.96, y=9.46)', 'MACF1 (x=0.54, y=-4.13)', 'MTA2 (x=-2.49, y=-3.54)', 'NOMO2 (x=-3.28, y=-3.08)', 'PHF2 (x=6.94, y=1.68)']
