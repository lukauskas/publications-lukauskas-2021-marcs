Principal Component embedding of log2-transformed, normalised, and unfiltered dataset, including only the rows which have no missing values.
The principal component 1 (PC1) is plotted on the X axis, while the PC2 is plotted on the Y. 
The explained variance ratio is highlighted in parentheses.

Note that the experiment types (colour, see legend on the right) cluster together much better after the normalisation.
