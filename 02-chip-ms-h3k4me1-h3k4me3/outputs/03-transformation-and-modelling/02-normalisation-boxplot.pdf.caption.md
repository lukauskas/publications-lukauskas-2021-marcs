Boxplot showing the distribution of signal intensities for non-histone proteins (green), and the histone proteins (orange), prior to normalisation.
The intensity is plotted on the X axis, while the samples are facetted on the Y. The outliers ("fliers") are hidden.

Black line shows the estimated normalisation offsets centred around the mean of normalisation proteins.
