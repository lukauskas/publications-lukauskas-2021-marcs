Heatmap of the significant `logFC` estimates for the H3K4me3vsH3K4me1 coefficient.
The proteins are sorted by the estimate, descending.

The left heatmap plots the `logFC` estimate, the colour axis limits are set to [-6.0, 6.0].
The right heatmap shows the data used for modelling, standardised to have mean(H3K4me3 and H3K4me1) = 0. 

Missing values are marked in grey.
