Heatmap of the imputed `logFC` estimates for the H3K4me1vsControl coefficient.
The proteins are sorted by the estimate, descending.

The left heatmap plots the imputed `logFC` estimate, the colour axis limits are set to [-8.0, 8.0].
Note that some imputed logFC estimates are infinite (which may be both positive or negative). Such points are displayed at the darkest shade of respective colour.

The right heatmap shows the data used for modelling in viridis colour scale. 
Note that all imptued estimates were infered from partial data only.
