MA-like plot for log2-transformed, normalised and unfiltered data.

X axis plots mean(log2_intensity) across data rows (proteins). X axis is the same in every plot.
Y axis plots log2_intensity - mean(log2_intensity) offsets for individual samples

Histone proteins are highlighted in green.

Red line indicates x=0 line around which the data is centered now.
