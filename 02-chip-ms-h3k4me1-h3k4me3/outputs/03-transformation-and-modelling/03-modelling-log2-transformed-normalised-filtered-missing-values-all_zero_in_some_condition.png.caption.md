Distribution of missing values in the log2-transformed, normalised, and filtered data of proteins that correspond to "special cases" in the modeling as they have all zero values in at least one of the conditions.
The heatmap above displays all 102 of such proteins, sorted by their missing value pattern. 
Dark values indicate the presence of a value, while white space indicates the absence of one. 
The sparkline on the right hand side counts the number of values per protein, which ranges from zero to 12 in this dataset.
