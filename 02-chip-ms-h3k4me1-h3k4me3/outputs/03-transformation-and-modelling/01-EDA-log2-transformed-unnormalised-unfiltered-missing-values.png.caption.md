Distribution of missing values in the log2-transformed, unnormalised, and unfiltered data. The heatmap above displays all 1046 proteins in the data in rows, and all experiments in columns. Dark values indicate the presence of a value, while white space indicates the absence of one. The sparkline on the right hand side counts the number of values per protein, which ranges from zero to 12 in this dataset.
