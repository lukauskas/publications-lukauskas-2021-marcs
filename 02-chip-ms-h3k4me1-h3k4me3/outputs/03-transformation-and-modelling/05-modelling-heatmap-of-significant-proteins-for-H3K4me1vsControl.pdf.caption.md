Heatmap of the significant `logFC` estimates for the H3K4me1vsControl coefficient.
The proteins are sorted by the estimate, descending.

The left heatmap plots the `logFC` estimate, the colour axis limits are set to [-4.0, 4.0].
The right heatmap shows the data used for modelling, standardised to have zero mean of controls (H3 and H4). 

Missing values are marked in grey.
