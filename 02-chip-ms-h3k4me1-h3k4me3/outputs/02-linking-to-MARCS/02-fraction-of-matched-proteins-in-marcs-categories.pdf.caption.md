Fraction of proteins in MARCS feature categories that were matched in ChIP-MS.

The colour highlights the fraction using the viridis colour scale on the right.
The annotated textdisplays the actual numbers of matched proteins (first number),
the total number of proteins in the category (second number, after slash), 
and the percentage of matched proteins between MARCS feature and ChIP-MS.

Heatmap is sorted by number of matched proteins, descending.
