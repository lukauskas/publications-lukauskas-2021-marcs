Fraction of proteins in MARCS feature categories that were matched in ChIP-MS.
The annotated text displays the actual numbers of matched proteins (first number),
the total number of proteins in the category (second number, after slash), 
the percentage of matched proteins between MARCS feature and ChIP-MS, 
and the expected number of matched proteins (if matching was random across the whole MARCS dataset - number prefixed by Exp). 

The colour highlights the pearson residual (observed-expected/sqrt(expected)). Red categories are strongly over-represented, blue - underrepresented

Heatmap is sorted by number of matched proteins, descending.
