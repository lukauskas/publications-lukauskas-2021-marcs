    Heatmap of all proteins with significant feeature effects for H3K4me3.
    Proteins are sorted by this effect, in descending order.

    The first panel plots the estimate of the differential effect between H3K4me3 and H3K4me1.
    Red colour (positive values) indicates preference to H3K4me3, while blue colour indicates preference to H3K4me1.
    Smaller markers indicate estimates which have only one datapoint in one of the conditions.
    Proteins markedwith an infinity symbol have infinite enrichments (as they were not detected in one of the conditions being compared).
    The colour scale limits are +/- 6.0. 

    The second panel plots the estimates for the respective enrichments against control (H3 & H4) ChIPs.
    Red colour indicates positive fold change (enrichment), blue colour indicates depletion.
    Black border around the markers indicates statistical significance.
    Diamond shaped values indicate "imputed" estimates in cases where model failed to generate one.
    One special case of such estimates is the case where protein was detected in ChIP of me1/3, but not
    the control ChIPs. Such cases are marked with infinity symbols as they represent infinite enrichments.

    The rightmost panel lists MARCS feature breakdown and their corresponding effects.
    Red colour indicates positive effeects (Recruitments), while blue colour highlights exclusions.
    Black border indicates significant effects. Larger squares highlight "strong" enrichments.
