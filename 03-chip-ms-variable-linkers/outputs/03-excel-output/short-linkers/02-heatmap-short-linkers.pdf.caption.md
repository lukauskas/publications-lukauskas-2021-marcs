Heatmap of protein responses to the short-linkers experiments.
Proteins are plotted in rows, experiments in columns.
Heatmap on the left colour codes proteins that respond to
either linkers (blue) or modifications (red) in each of the experiments.
Only proteins that respond to any linker or modification are shown.

Clustering (ward) dendrograms are shown on the left or the bottom.
Colour scale represents log2 fold change normalised to mean control experiment.
