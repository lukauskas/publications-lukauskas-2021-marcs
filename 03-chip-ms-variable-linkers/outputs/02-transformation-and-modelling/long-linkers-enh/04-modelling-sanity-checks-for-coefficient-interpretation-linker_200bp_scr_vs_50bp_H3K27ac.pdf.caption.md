    Comparison of the linker_200bp_scr_vs_50bp_H3K27ac coefficient estimates computed by the model (y axis), and their expected values (x axis).
    The expected values were computed naively - by subtracting the coresponding means from each other.
    The actual values were computed using the limma statistical model.
    
    The scatterpoint highlight individual protein estimates, the line is a linear regression estimate.
    The 95% confidence interval for pearson R estimate is written in the top left corner.
    
    If the model is working correctly, we would expect a perfect fit here.
