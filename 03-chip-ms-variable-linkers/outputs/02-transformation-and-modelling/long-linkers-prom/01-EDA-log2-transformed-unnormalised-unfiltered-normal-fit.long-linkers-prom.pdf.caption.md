Distribution of non-null values of log2-transformed, unnormalised, and unfiltered dataset (long-linkers-prom). 
The rows facet the four experiment types, while the columns split the data per replicate.
The green distribution plot shows the histogram of observed log2 values in the data.
The black curve shows the corresponding normal distribution fit to the data, whose parameters are written in the top-right corner.
The black vertical line indicates the mean ($\mu$) estimate.
