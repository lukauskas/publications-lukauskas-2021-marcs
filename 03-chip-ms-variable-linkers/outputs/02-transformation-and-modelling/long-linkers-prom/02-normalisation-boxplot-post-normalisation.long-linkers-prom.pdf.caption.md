Boxplot showing the distribution of signal intensities for non-histone proteins (green), and the histone proteins (orange), after  normalisation by the mean of histone protein intensities (long-linkers-prom).
The intensity is plotted on the X axis, while the samples are facetted on the Y. The outliers ("fliers") are hidden.
