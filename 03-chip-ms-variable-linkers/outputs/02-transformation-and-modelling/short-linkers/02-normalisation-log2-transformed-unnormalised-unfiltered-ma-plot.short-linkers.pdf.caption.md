MA-like plot for log2-transformed, unnormalised and unfiltered data (short-linkers).

X axis plots mean(log2_intensity) across data rows (proteins). X axis is the same in every plot.
Y axis plots log2_intensity - mean(log2_intensity) offsets for individual samples

Histone proteins are highlighted in green.
Red line indicates the normalisation factor estimate.
