Distribution of missing values in the log2-transformed, normalised, and filtered data which will be used for modelling. 
The heatmap above displays all  929 proteins remaining in the data after filtering in rows, and all experiments in columns. 
Dark values indicate the presence of a value, while white space indicates the absence of one. 
The sparkline on the right hand side counts the number of values per protein, which ranges from zero to 12 in this dataset.
