Distribution of missing values in the log2-transformed, unnormalised, and unfiltered data (short-linkers). 
The heatmap above displays all proteins in the data in rows, and all experiments in columns. Dark values indicate the presence of a value, while white space indicates the absence of one. The sparkline on the right hand side counts the number of values per protein.
