    A scatterplot diagram of model estimates.

    The first plot simply plots the whole data, the second plot highlights proteins used to normalise the data, while the remaining three plots highlight proteins for which
    the corresponding estimates are statistically non zero. (limma, at FDR 0.05, BH correction).
    Labels are displayed for a handful of outlier proteins.
